Running the Program
Overview
This project runs on an Arduino-compatible microcontroller and controls music playback using a buzzer, push button, and LCD display. 
Button presses cycle through different songs, which are shown on the LCD and played through the buzzer.

Hardware Requirements:

- Arduino-compatible microcontroller
- 16×2 LCD display
-Piezo buzzer
-Push button
-Jumper wires and breadboard

Pin Connections:
- Button: Digital pin 12 (INPUT_PULLUP)
- Buzzer: Analog pin A5
LCD:
RS → Pin 2
EN → Pin 3
D4 → Pin 6
D5 → Pin 7
D6 → Pin 8
D7 → Pin 9


Software Requirements:
- Arduino IDE
- LiquidCrystal library
- Custom header files (pitches.h, row.h, odeToJoy.h, Despacito.h) included in the project directory

How to Run:

1. Connect the hardware according to the pin mapping above.
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Verify that all required header files are in the same folder as the main .ino file.
4. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the program to the microcontroller.


Operation:

- Power the board after uploading.
- Press the button to cycle through available songs.
- The LCD displays the current selection with scrolling text.
- The buzzer plays the selected melody.
