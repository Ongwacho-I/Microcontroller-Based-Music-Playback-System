# Microcontroller-Based-Music-Playback-System
This project implements an embedded system using a microcontroller to control music playback via a buzzer, with user input through a push button and feedback on an LCD. It uses hardware interrupts, debouncing, and a finite state machine, demonstrating GPIO control, ISRs, and embedded C/C++ design.
